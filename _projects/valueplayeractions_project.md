Continuing my Sports Analytics learning, I found [these Notebooks](https://github.com/soccer-analytics-research/fot-valuing-actions) for the Friends of Tracking project. There, an interesting approach for valuing actions in football is presented.

I followed their notebooks again in Kaggle, using the Wyscout open data. The notebooks can be found below.

## notebooks

 1. [Analyze models and results](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aleespinosa/friendsoftracking-valuing-actions-in-football-4)
