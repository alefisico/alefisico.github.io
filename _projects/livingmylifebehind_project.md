El Camino de Santiago is the biggest adventure of my life. It is an 800 km walk on North Spain along the path followed for centuries by peregrinos around the world. I did it in 35 days and I documented all the process in pictures and videos. All this content is located in the following [website](http://lnk.bio/livingmylifebehind).
