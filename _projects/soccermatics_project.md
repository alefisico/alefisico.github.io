I am an sports aficionado and since I discover the field of __sports analytics__ I want it to learn as much as I can about it. This project is under construction and currently I will start adding a new thoughts and notebooks related to it.

In this project, I am following the videos/lectures from this [Mathematical Modelling of Football](https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/44338) from [David Sumpter](https://www.david-sumpter.com/), author of [Soccermatics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26073086-soccermatics).

My idea is to learn from the series the "state-of-the-art" in football analytics, and from there start my playing with that data. I recommend to watch all the videos in the lectures and/or also watch the videos in the [Friends-of-Tracking](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUBFJYcag8j2rm_9HkrrA7w) youtube channel.

## notebooks

First, I am trying to replicate all the [SoccermaticsForPython](https://github.com/Friends-of-Tracking-Data-FoTD/SoccermaticsForPython) exercises from the Friends of Tracking folks. My Kaggle notebooks are here:

 1. [Load Football Data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aleespinosa/soccermatics-for-python-1)
 1. [Plot shots and passes](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aleespinosa/soccermatics-for-python-2)
 1. [xG Model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aleespinosa/soccermatics-for-python-3)
 1. [Linear Regression](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aleespinosa/soccermatics-for-python-4)
 1. [xG Model Fit](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aleespinosa/soccermatics-for-python-5)
 1. [Measures Of Fit](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aleespinosa/soccermatics-for-python-6)
 1. [Pass heatmap](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aleespinosa/soccermatics-for-python-7)
 1. [Pass Compare](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aleespinosa/soccermatics-for-python-8)
 1. [Shot Times](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aleespinosa/soccermatics-for-python-9)
 1. [Goals per game](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aleespinosa/soccermatics-for-python-10)
 1. [Simulate Matches](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aleespinosa/soccermatics-for-python-11)


I am also trying to make the assignments from the class. Here are the links to the Kaggle notebooks:

 1. [Assigment 1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aleespinosa/soccermatics-for-python-assignment-1?scriptVersionId=95185044): I choose to analyze the performance of Antoine Griezmann during the 2018 Men's World Cup.
