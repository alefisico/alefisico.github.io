Welcome to my corner of the web. Here I am storing my portfolio, projects, academic life, and even my thoughts.

I am an accomplished Ecuadorian scientist specializing in ``Experimental High Energy Physics``, with more than 10 years of academic experience spanning different institutions: [Fermilab](https://lpc.fnal.gov/), [Rutgers University](https://physics.rutgers.edu/research/high-energy-experiment), [ETH-Zurich](https://wallny-group.phys.ethz.ch/), and [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/index.html). My primary research area centers on the [CMS Experiment](https://cms.cern), one of the [CERN-LHC](https://home.web.cern.ch) experiments with a diverse stakeholder base of over 4,000 individuals. Working at CERN has afforded me the opportunity to lead and collaborate with large, multicultural groups both in-person and remotely.

Throughout my career, I have specialized in the reconstruction of physical objects produced in high-energy collisions, namely jets. I have conducted in-depth analyses of these (multi-)jet signatures for standard model measurements and new physics searches, processing petabyte-scale datasets with advanced statistical tools. My contributions have resulted in over 5 scientific publications, where I played a direct role in the production of data-driven frameworks using programming languages like Python and C++.

As a skilled communicator, I have presented my research to large audiences of over 500 stakeholders. My scientific curiosity and enthusiasm have inspired me to explore machine learning algorithms and cloud computing applications to optimize data processing.

<!-- I am committed to lifelong learning, continually seeking to expand my skill set and knowledge base through [Coursera specializations](https://www.coursera.org/user/245b92b57d7282521f16a2c7e48a454b) and participating in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aleespinosa) competitions. -->
