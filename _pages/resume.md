 - Technical tools: Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Jupyter-notebooks, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Bigquery, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Docker, Kubernetes, Tidyverse, ggplot2, Linux, Git,  Spreadsheets, Tableau.
 - Machine Learning: Regression, Classification, Feature engineering, Data Scraping, MC Methods.
 - Soft skills: Lead and collaborate with multicultural groups of 20+ people in person and remotely. Communicate results to 500+ stakeholders in conferences and write scientific peer-review documents.
 - Languages: English (fluent), Spanish (Native).


### Professional Experience

<!-- You have to wrap the "left" and "right" half of these headings in spans by
hand -->
##### *Data Scientist*, CERN-CMS Experiment (2011 -- Present)

 * Built an academic career over a decade as part of a team of 2000+ stakeholders in one of the CERN experiments, representing three different institutions.
 * Designed and optimized over five multi-class C++/Python frameworks to analyze petabyte-scale data and simulations, resulting in significant acceleration of processing times from weeks to days.
 * Authored and co-authored over five peer-reviewed scientific publications.
 * __Leadership Experience__:
   * *Jet Algorithms Convener* (2019-2021) - Directed and led a research group of over 20 stakeholders, successfully coordinating with competing partners to produce and publish reports.
   * *Trigger Subgroup Convener* (2016-2017). Coordinated the deployment of real-time data filters for a research group consisting of more than 30 stakeholders.

##### *Postdoctoral Research Assistant*, ETH Zurich (2018 -- 2022)

 * Managed the development of two machine learning-based techniques, which were trained in simulations and implemented in data, with the aim
of enhancing the filtration of rare theoretically predicted phenomena. The successful implementation of these techniques resulted in a 10% increase in filtering efficiency.
 * Recognized and investigated two underexplored research areas and developed innovative strategies to address them, resulting in the publication of scientific research papers.
 * Oversaw the completion of three Ph.D. and two master's-level final projects as a supervisor.


##### *Research Assistant*, Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey (2012 -- 2018)

 * Conducted feasibility studies of novel theoretical models and implemented new data-driven techniques to estimate predictions, resulting in the authorship of two scientific publications.
 * Optimized signal-to-background discriminant variables, achieving a 20% improvement over previous results.
 * Conceptualized, designed, and deployed three real-time data collection filters, optimizing the probability of capturing scarce yet significant data for the first time.
 <!-- * Co-supervised 5 undergraduate-level final projects. -->


##### *Visitor Research Student*, Fermilab (2011 -- 2012)

 * Implemented a novel analysis framework using C++ and multivariate techniques, specifically boosted decision trees, to study the production of rare theoretical models for the first time.
 * The results obtained during this internship program were incorporated into my bachelor's project and contributed to a published research paper.

### Education

 - *Doctor of Philosophy, Experimental Particle Physics*. Rutgets, The State University of New Jersey - USA.  (2012-2018)
 - *Bachelor of Science*, Physics. Escuela Politecnica Nacional - Ecuador (2007-2012)
 - Continuous Education:
   - Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate - Google (Coursera, 2022)
   - Deep Learning Specialization - Deep Learning.AI (Coursera, 2022)
   - Sport Performance Analytics Specialization - U. Michigan (Coursera, 2021)
   <!-- - Containers and Cloud Computing Workshop (CERN, 2019) -->

### Additional information

As an Ecuadorian citizen, I require support with obtaining a work visa for relevant job opportunities.
